# kmc2d

KMC2D: A 2D lattice kinetic Monte Carlo model constructor and simulator. 

Create custom potential energy surfaces with an intuitive system interface, and then run and analyse fully dynamic constant temperature KMC simulations. 

Key features include:

- Create 2D cluster or periodic models with any type of site occupation and connectivity 
- Unique interface for implementing periodic models
- System expansion and replication tools
- Visualisation of barriers and minium energy paths
- Export and import of models in an XML format
- Real time visualisation of simulation progress
- Extensive simulation analysis and plotting functionality
- Export of simulation trajectory as XYZ formal animation

Built using C++ and Qt 5.6.
